## Executive Summary  

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) supports diverse missions: Earth observation, communications, navigation, microgravity research, on-orbit manufacturing, and space tourism.  
The orbital environment is increasingly congested: **>40,000 tracked objects** and **~11,000 active payloads**, with millions of fragments below catalog thresholds [1][2].  

**Concept — Shared Orbital Bus (SOB):**  
A modular ESPA-class spacecraft hosting multiple independent payloads and providing shared services:  

- Electrical power, propulsion, ADCS, thermal control, and communications  
- Standardized docking and refueling port  
- Active end-of-life deorbit capability  

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- Reduced per-payload cost through bus and launch cost sharing  
- Lower orbital object count and lifecycle risk  
- Shorter integration and market access for payload providers  
- Built-in sustainability via servicing and disposal workflows

## Problem Definition  

- Increasing LEO demand → multiple redundant buses and propulsion systems per payload.  
- ESA (2025) reports ~40,000 tracked objects; NASA ORDEM predicts collision probability rising with debris flux [1][2].  
- Result: higher launch cadence, higher operational cost, greater collision risk.

## Proposed Solution  

**Core Structure**  
- ESPA-class ring with integrated service module  
- Includes EPS, ADCS, propulsion, thermal management, and avionics  

**Hosted Payloads**  
- Six modular ports supporting hosted instruments or separable CubeSats  

**Service Port**  
- Standardized interface including electrical, data, and fluidic connections  
- Docking compatible with robotic servicing (heritage from NASA RRM and MEV)

## Value Proposition  

- **Cost Efficiency:** Shared bus architecture amortizes development and launch costs  
- **Faster Deployment:** Payload developers bypass bus development and ground segment creation  
- **Sustainability:** Standardized servicing and controlled end-of-life deorbit reduce debris accumulation  
- **Flexibility:** Capable of supporting scientific, commercial, and communications payloads

## Methodology  

1. Baseline architecture: ESPA-class mechanical interface  
2. Payload accommodation: 4–6 hosted ports, two service ports  
3. Orbital environment analysis: NASA ORDEM 3.2 and ESA debris data for shielding and maneuver sizing  
4. Propulsion selection: electric propulsion for station-keeping and deorbit, monopropellant backup for contingencies  
5. Docking/refueling interface derived from RRM lessons  
6. Economic model comparing shared bus vs. single-payload buses
